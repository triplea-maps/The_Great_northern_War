<h1>The Great Northern War </h1> <br> <br>     <b> Created by: Doctor Che </b> <br>      The Great Northern War (1700-21) ended the Swedish Empire, leaving Russia dominant in the Baltic Sea and a major <br>     player in European politics. The war began as a coordinated attack on Sweden by the coalition in 1700 and ended <br>     in 1721 with the Treaty of Nystad and the Stockholm treaties. It was fought between a coalition of Russia, Denmark-Norway, <br>     and Saxony (also the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1701 and Prussia and Hanover from 1715) and many smaller <br>     northgerman states on one side and Sweden, which was partially helped by the Ottoman Empire (who later left the war) on the other. <br>     <br>     Units Stat:<br>     Infantry: cost=3 / attack=1 / defence=2 / movement=1 / transport cost=2 / artillery supportable<br>     Cavalry: cost=3 / attack=1 / defence=1 / movement=2 / transport cost=3 / can blitz / artillery<br>     Artillery: cost=4 / attack=2 / defence=2 / movement=1 / transport cost=3 / artillery<br>     Corvette: cost=8 / attack=1 / defence=2 / movement=2 / transport capacity=5<br>     Battleship: cost=18 / attack=3 / defence=2 / movement=2 / transport capacity=8 / 2 hit<br>     City: cost=15 / attack=0 / defence=0 / movement=0 / factory<br>     Fortress: cost=6 / attack=0 / defence=4 / movement=0 / 2 hit<br>     <br>     Land Connections over Sea Zones:<br>     Kobenhavn - Malmo<br>     Kobenhavn - Aarhus<br>     Kobenhavn - Schleswig<br>     <br>     <br>     <br>Converted up to TripleA 1.2.5.x by Veqryn     <br>
